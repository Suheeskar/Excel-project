# Excel project

I analyzed a dataset on bike purchases to identify patterns and insights related to the target variable of whether a person bought a bike or not. After cleaning the data, I used occupation, commute distance, and gender as factors to analyze. One significant insight I found was that middle-aged males tend to have a higher likelihood of purchasing a bike and higher average income. Additionally, I observed that people who live closer to their workplace tend to buy more bikes, with those who live within 1 mile purchasing the most, while those who live far away purchased the least.
